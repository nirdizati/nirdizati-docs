	Abstract = {The management of business processes has recently received a lot of attention. One of the most interesting problems is the description of a process model in a language that allows the checking of the compliance of a process execution (or trace) to the model. In this paper we propose a language  for the representation of process models that is inspired to the SCIFF language and is an extension of clausal logic.
A process model is represented in the language as a set of integrity constraints that allow conjunctive formulas as disjuncts in the head.
We present an approach for inducing these models from data: we define a subsumption relation for the integrity constraints, we define a refinement operator and we adapt the algorithm ICL to the problem of learning such formulas. The system has been applied to the problem of inducing the model of a sealed bid auction and of the NetBill protocol. The data used for learning and testing were randomly generated from correct models of the processes.},

	information. This type of monitoring, however, has limitations mostly
	related to the type and amount of information available in events
	and pro- cess engines. We propose a novel approach ? model-aware
	monitoring of business processes ? to address these limitations.
	Emitted events contain unique identifiers of models that can be retrieved
	dynamically during runtime from a model-aware repository and service
	environment (MORSE). The size of the events is kept small and patterns
	of events that signify interesting occurrences are identified through
	complex event processing and are signaled to interesting components
	such as a business intelligence. To illustrate our approach we present
	an industry case study where we have applied this generic infrastructure
	for the compliance monitoring of business processes},

  month = apr,
  abstract = {Business Process Compliance {(BPC)} has gained significant momentum
	in research and practice during the last years. Although many approaches
	address {BPC}, they mostly assume the existence of some kind of unified
	base of process constraints and focus on their verification over
	the business processes. However, it remains unclear how such an inte-
	grated process constraint base can be built up, even though this
	con- stitutes the essential prerequisite for all further compliance
	checks. In addition, the heterogeneity of process constraints has
	been neglected so far. Without identification and separation of process
	constraints from domain rules as well as unification of process constraints,
	the success- ful {IT} support of {BPC} will not be possible. In this
	technical report we introduce a unified representation framework
	that enables the identifica- tion of process constraints from domain
	rules and their later unification within a process constraint base.
	Separating process constraints from domain rules can lead to significant
	reduction of compliance checking effort. Unification enables consistency
	checks and optimizations as well as maintenance and evolution of
	the constraint base on the other side.},

	major challenge in literature and practice. Although process instances
	are, for example, often required to share resources such as printers
	or centrifuges, the necessary instance synchronization is not supported
	by most process engines. While existing (scarcely supported) patterns
	deal with the intra-process synchronization of activities, a model
	for a more generic synchronization mechanism is still missing. The
	contribution of this paper is two-fold. (1) We introduce a generic
	model to describe the state transitions of process instances at runtime,
	and based on this model (2) define a subscription based event / voting
	mechanism that enables arbitrary synchronization within and between
	running instances. In order to demonstrate the validity of our approach,
	we will conduct an extensive evaluation against existing synchronization
	patterns, as well as describe a generic rule engine prototype that
	implements the presented approach.},
